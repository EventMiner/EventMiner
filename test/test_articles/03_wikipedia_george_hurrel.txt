In the late 1920s, Hurrell was introduced to the actor Ramon Novarro, by Pancho Barnes, and agreed to take a series
of photographs of him.[2] Novarro was impressed with the results and showed them to the actress Norma Shearer, who
was attempting to mould her wholesome image into something more glamorous and sophisticated in an attempt to land the
title role in the movie The Divorcee.[2] She asked Hurrell to photograph her in poses more provocative than her fans
had seen before. After she showed these photographs to her husband, MGM production chief Irving Thalberg, Thalberg was
so impressed that he signed Hurrell to a contract with MGM Studios, making him head of the portrait photography
department. But in 1932, Hurrell left MGM after differences with their publicity head,[3] and from then on until 1938
ran his own studio at 8706 Sunset Boulevard.[4]

Throughout the decade, Hurrell photographed every star contracted to MGM, and his striking black-and-white images were
used extensively in the marketing of these stars. Among the performers regularly photographed by him during these years
were silent screen star Dorothy Jordan, as well as Myrna Loy, Robert Montgomery, Jean Harlow, Joan Crawford, Clark
Gable, Rosalind Russell, Marion Davies, Jeanette MacDonald, Anna May Wong, Carole Lombard and Norma Shearer, who was
said to have refused to allow herself to be photographed by anyone else. He also photographed Greta Garbo at a session
to produce promotional material for the movie Romance. The session didn't go well and she never used him again.[5]

In the early 1940s Hurrell moved to Warner Brothers Studios photographing, among others Bette Davis, Ann Sheridan,
Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Ida Lupino, Alexis Smith, Maxine Fife, Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney. Later in the
decade he moved to Columbia Pictures where his photographs were used to help the studio build the career of Rita
Hayworth.
