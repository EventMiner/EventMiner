In 2000, Bashar al-Assad took over as President of Syria upon Hafez al-Assadâ€²s death. He and his wife Asma al-Assad, a Sunni Muslim born and educated in Britain,[126] initially inspired hopes for democratic reforms. A Damascus Spring of social and political debate took place between July 2000 and August 2001.[127] The Damascus Spring largely ended in August 2001 with the arrest and imprisonment of ten leading activists who had called for democratic elections and a campaign of civil disobedience.[128] In the opinion of his critics, Bashar Assad had failed to deliver on promised reforms.[129]
