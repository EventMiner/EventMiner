Over 2,400 species of mantis in about 430 genera are recognized.[1] They are predominantly found in tropical regions,
but some live in temperate areas.[2][3] The systematics of mantises have long been disputed. Mantises, along with stick
insects (Phasmatodea), were once placed in the order Orthoptera with the cockroaches (now Blattodea) and rock crawlers
(now Grylloblattodea). Kristensen (1991) combined the Mantodea with the cockroaches and termites into the order
Dictyoptera, suborder Mantodea.[4][5] The name mantodea is formed from the Ancient Greek words μάντις (mantis) meaning
"prophet", and εἶδος (eidos) meaning "form" or "type". It was coined in 1838 by the German entomologist Hermann
Burmeister.[6][7] The order is occasionally called the mantes, using a Latinized plural of Greek mantis. The name
mantid properly refers only to members of the family Mantidae, which was, historically, the only family in the order.
The other common name, praying mantis, applied to any species in the order,[8] but in Europe mainly to Mantis religiosa,
comes from the typical "prayer-like" posture with folded fore limbs.[9][10]

The classification most commonly adopted is that proposed by Beier in 1968. He divided the order into eight families.
[11] Klass, in 1997, studied the external male genitalia and postulated that the families Chaeteessidae and
Metallyticidae diverged from the other families at an early date.[12] However, the Mantidae and Thespidae are
both polyphyletic, so the Mantodea will have to be revised.[13]

Mantidfly (Mantispidae) looks much like a mantis without leathery forewings
Mantidflies (Mantispidae, related to lacewings), have raptorial fore legs like mantises, but their fore wings are not
leathery.
The earliest mantis fossils are about 135 million years old, from Siberia.[13] Fossils of the group are rare: by 2007,
only about 25 fossil species were known.[13] Fossil mantises, including one from Japan with spines on the front legs as
in modern mantises, have been found in Cretaceous amber.[14] Most fossils in amber are nymphs; compression fossils
(in rock) include adults. Fossil mantises from the Crato Formation in Brazil include the 10-mm-long Santanmantis
axelrodi, described in 2003; as in modern mantises, the front legs were adapted for catching prey. Well-preserved
specimens yield details as small as 5 μm through X-ray computed tomography.[13]

Because of the similar raptorial fore legs, mantidflies may be confused with mantises. This similarity is an example
of convergent evolution; mantidflies do not have the leathery forewings of mantises.[15]
