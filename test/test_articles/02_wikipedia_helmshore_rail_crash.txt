There was a major railway accident in Helmshore in September 1860. There were eleven lives lost and 77 people were
injured. The accident happened on the line between Snig Hole and the Ogden Viaduct, both local beauty spots, 400 yards
from Helmshore station. About 3,000 people had gone from East Lancashire on three excursion trains to Salford to visit
the attractions at Belle Vue Gardens.[7]

The second train with about 1,000 passengers and 31 carriages got to Helmshore Station where it stopped to let out some
passengers. "When the guard released the brakes there was a jerk and 16 carriages broke away from the train and started
sliding down the line between Helmshore and Ramsbottom. Mr Shaw, the superintendent, saw what had happened and unhooked
the engine from the train in order to go down the other line to warn the third train, but unfortunately he was too late.
The carriages had already run 400 yards down the line and collided with the oncoming train."[8]
